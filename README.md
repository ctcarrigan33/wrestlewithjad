# Description
  Allows users to search for restaurants in a given airport based on terminal, cuisine, price, and restaurant style (Yelp for airports). Currently supports Houston and San Francisco airports.        
 
# Backlog
  * Add more airports
  * Reactive Front end. Mobile Ready
  * GPS location search
  * Make database calls more efficient
  * Restructure database so you don't have to write any repeat information (restaurant table could probably be split)
  * Have search work for airport 3 letter codes
  * Have search bar show possible results as you type.
  * fix carousel so that when you open debug console, it doesn't look different
  * have search bar go back to normal if you go back to splash page.
